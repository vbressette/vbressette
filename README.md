## Welcome to my page! 

I am currently a student at Arizona State University, majoring in Human Systems Engineering with a concentration in User Experience. I am getting started with coding, but enjoying the process! I have always been passionate about understanding the psychology behind the creation of user interfaces, and how I can integrate this with my other passion of Sustainability.
